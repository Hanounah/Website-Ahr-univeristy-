<p>Do you want to learn swimming even if you are pressure with your study or you do not have time?</p>

<p>We decide to open course that teach swimming on every Wednesday to give student the chance to learn even if they busy with their study and it will be evening after all faculty’s courses completed.</p>

<p>We will provide activities that allow all the university’s students to learn swimming perfectly by the swimming coach that will observe each students ability, teach them the swimming techniques and help them to avoid fair from learning swimming.</p>
<p>Later, when our course done we goal to do competition with rewards for student that prove they have learned and able to swim in such swimming pool with various depth.</p>
